## 📌 Project Overview

Smart Expiry Guardian is an intelligent, AI-assisted expiry date tracking system designed to help users manage food, medicine, and cosmetic products efficiently. It prevents wastage, improves safety, and provides timely alerts for soon-to-expire products — along with donation/exchange recommendations.

The system uses:

- OCR (Tesseract.js / Vision API) for extracting expiry dates from uploaded images
- React + TypeScript for the frontend
- Node.js + Express for backend API
- MongoDB for data persistence
- GSAP, Framer Motion for stunning animations and UI
- Cloudinary for image uploads
- Health risk alert logic for sensitive groups (diabetic, cardiac, TB, allergy, etc.)

## 🎯 Aim of the Project

The goal of Smart Expiry Guardian is to make expiry date tracking automatic and user-friendly by:

- Reducing food & medicine wastage
- Preventing health risks caused by consuming expired or harmful products
- Helping communities donate or exchange nearly expired items
- Creating an AI-powered smart kitchen & medical cabinet assistant

- ✔ Authentication-ready structure

### 🔥 AI & Logic Features

#### 🧠 OCR (AI Text Extraction)

- Extracts expiry date from product image
- Cleans text using regex
- Parses date formats:

#### 🚨 Smart Alerts

- Soon expiring (≤ 7 days left)
- Expired items
- High-risk items for patients, e.g.,
  - Diabetic → warnings about high sugar items
  - Cardiac → high sodium alerts
  - TB → lactose & certain preservatives alerts
  - Allergy → ingredients detected in OCR

#### 🙌 Donation / Exchange Suggestions

- If a product expires in 1–5 days → show donation suggestions.
